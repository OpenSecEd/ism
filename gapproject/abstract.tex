In this project we will explore information security management in 
organizations further.
In particular, it will provide some practical experience.

After this project you should be able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{analyse} threats to information security and to \emph{suggest} 
    suitable protection mechanisms against these.
  \item to \emph{apply} MSB's framework to analyse, evaluate and give 
    suggestions of improvements for the information security in an 
    organization.
\end{itemize}

The work is based on the material by MSB:
\citetitle{MSB2011gap}~\cite{MSB2011gap} med bilaga~\cite{MSB2011gb}.
